I am a third-year Ph.D. student in the Supply Chain and Operations department at the Carlson School of Management, University of Minnesota. My research integrates work in operations management with insights from organizational theory and sociology to understand why organizations and individuals engage in organizational misconduct, how we can mitigate it, and what the consequences of such wrongdoing are.
